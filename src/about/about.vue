        About
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I’m 22 years old, passionate about solving problems, and continuously learning, especially in the areas of new technologies, programming languages, and the financial market.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I have experience collaborating with international teams across different regions, including the USA, Europe, and Latin America, while working remotely. This has allowed me to exchange knowledge with colleagues from diverse backgrounds, helping me develop strong communication skills and adapt to various work cultures, which enables me to deliver high-quality solutions in a global context.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        On the frontend, I work with React, Vue, TypeScript, and CSS preprocessors like SCSS. On the backend, I have solid experience with Node.js, NoSQL, and SQL.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I’ve worked extensively within the Ethereum ecosystem, developing at both the protocol level (using Solidity with cutting-edge tools like Truffle and Hardhat) and at the dApp level with web3.js and front-end frameworks.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I also developed
        an extension wallet (<a
          class="text-blue-800"
          href="https://paliwallet.com/"
          target="_blank"
          >paliwallet.com</a
        >) along with the Syscoin blockchain, where I have been
        working on top of the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-blue-800"
          >bitcoinjs-lib</a
        > and <a
          href="https://github.com/syscoin/syscoinjs-lib"
          class="text-blue-800"
          target="_blank"
          >syscoinjs-lib</a
        >
        libraries, which deepened my understanding of blockchain structures and enabled me to build solutions on top of any Bitcoin chain.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I’ve also had the opportunity to work on projects in the vacation rental industry with
        <a
          href="https://stays.net/"
          class="text-blue-800"
          target="_blank"
          >Stays</a
        >, the leading vacation rental company in Latin America, where I gained experience with payment integrations and connecting to sales channels like Airbnb, Booking, and Decolar. I’ve worked with Docker, MongoDB, and Node.js to build backend solutions that are both efficient and scalable, further expanding my skills and enabling me to deliver quality results for the company.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I'm currently working on side projects using Rust, which are enhancing my skills in systems programming and performance optimization. Rust is challenging me to deepen my understanding of low-level development, and I’m excited to apply this knowledge to build high-performance and efficient solutions.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I’m always open to new challenges and ready to learn everything I can to
        do a good job and be better every day.
