        About
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-6 font-poppins">
        I’m 18 years old and I’m passionate about solving problems and learning,
        especially new technologies, languages and the financial market. 
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 font-poppins">
        I work with React, Vue, TypeScript and CSS preprocessors like SCSS at
        frontend. At backend I have experience with Node and NoSQL (MongoDB).
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 font-poppins">
        I have experience working on top of the Ethereum ecosystem. Developing
        from the protocol level (with Solidity as the main language, always
        using cutting edge tools to improve the process like Truffle or
        Hardhat) to the dApp level using web3.js with front-end frameworks. 
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 font-poppins">
        I also developed
        an extension wallet (<a
          class="text-blue-800"
          href="https://paliwallet.com/"
          target="_blank"
          >paliwallet.com</a
        >) along with the Syscoin blockchain during this year, where I have been
        working on top of the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-blue-800"
          >bitcoinjs-lib</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://github.com/syscoin/syscoinjs-lib"
          class="text-blue-800"
          target="_blank"
          >syscoinjs-lib</a
        >
        libraries, which is deepening my knowledge of the structure of
        blockchain itself and allowing me to build on top of any Bitcoin chain
        as well.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 font-poppins">
        I’m always open to new challenges and ready to learn everything I can to
        do a good job and be better every day.
      </p>
