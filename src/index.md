<Home title="Amanda Gonsalves" description="I'm a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience based in Brazil. I'm specialized in backend and blockchain development, with a strong track record in building scalable decentralized applications (dApps) and secure payment integrations. I’ve been working remotely since the start of my career. Since beginning my journey in 2020, I’ve focused on continuous learning and growth, taking on side projects to strengthen my skills. Since then, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience working remotely on complex systems and integrations. Now, I am dedicated to deepening my expertise and contributing to innovative software solutions as I continue to build my career in the remote work environment." background="/assets/images/geometric.jpg" />
