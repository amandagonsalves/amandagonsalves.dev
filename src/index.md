<Home title="Amanda Gonsalves" description="I’m a self-taught software engineer based in Florianópolis, Brazil, and I’ve been working remotely since the start of my career. Since beginning my journey in 2020, I’ve focused on continuous learning and growth, taking on side projects to strengthen my skills. In 2021, I got my first role as a engineer, and since then, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience working remotely on complex systems and integrations. Now, I am dedicated to deepening my expertise and contributing to innovative software solutions as I continue to build my career in the remote work environment." background="/assets/images/geometric.jpg" />
